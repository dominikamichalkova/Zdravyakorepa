##Webdesign class project 

The project to create a fully responsive simple webpage for a fictional pharmacy was done 2015 as a part of the class: Webdesign. It uses pure HTML5, CSS3 and simple javascript for particular page elements like: menu and image slideshow. It was created without any webframework. The focus lies on presentation, stylization of webpage elements rather than text content, that is why the text is generated lorem ipsum. Only minimal experiences with web beforehand. 

The project is hosted on free web hosting: http://zdravyakorepa.comxa.com/home.html from where you can access it.
